This is an open-source implementation of a reminder list app for Android.

This was originally implemented to be used for [ThaySolis](https://github.com/ThaySolis)'s presentation on reverse engineering for the 2024 Hacking na Web Day - Brasilia edition (HNWD 2024 - BrasÃ­lia). If you want to play with reverse engineering, I provided the APK in the releases section.
